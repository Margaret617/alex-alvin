  Happy birthday, Alex! 🌌💖<br />
  You’ve got that Tanjiro energy — soft heart, strong spirit, and a loyalty that could cut through demons and darkness alike. You move through life like a Hashira-in-training, turning every challenge into a training arc, every win into a peaceful sunset walk.<br />
  May this next chapter be full of growth, gear, and Nezuko-level glow-ups. Keep breathing — not just water, flame, or thunder… but joy, peace, and purpose.<br />
  Your story? Already a masterpiece. 🗡️🌸✨
